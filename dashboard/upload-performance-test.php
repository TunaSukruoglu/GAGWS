echo "BEFORE OPTIMIZATION (Serial Upload):\n";
echo "â€¢ 10 images Ã— 15 seconds each = 150 seconds (2.5 minutes)\n";
echo "â€¢ Each image uploaded one by one\n";
echo "â€¢ High network latency impact\n\n";

echo "AFTER OPTIMIZATION (Parallel Upload):\n";
echo "â€¢ 10 images Ã· 3 parallel = 4 batches\n";
echo "â€¢ Each batch ~20 seconds = 80 seconds total (1.3 minutes)\n";
echo "â€¢ 47% speed improvement!\n\n";

echo "EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS:\n";
echo "â€¢ 3-5 images: 40-60% faster\n";
echo "â€¢ 6-9 images: 50-65% faster\n";
echo "â€¢ 10+ images: 45-55% faster\n\n";

echo "TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:\n";
echo "âœ… Parallel cURL multi-handle processing\n";
echo "âœ… Optimized connection timeouts (20s vs 10s)\n";
echo "âœ… Smart batch processing (3 images per batch)\n";
echo "âœ… Reduced retry delays (0.1s vs 0.3s)\n";
echo "âœ… Improved error handling and reporting\n";
echo "âœ… Real-time progress tracking\n\n";

echo "NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING:\n";
echo "1. Create a new property with 5-10 images\n";
echo "2. Monitor debug.log for parallel upload messages\n";
echo "3. Compare actual vs estimated upload times\n";
echo "4. Verify all thumbnails are created correctly\n\n";
